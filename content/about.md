My name is Vladimir Petrovski and I am a mobile engineer. I am very much interested in [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) and constantly exploring all related technologies to it. Exploring the [ubiqutius computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing), helps me dive into very challenging every day problems and working on very awesome projects.

I am deeply working on improving my open source contributions, helping others and sharing my knowledge. This website is one of them.
