![Profile picture 2](/images/profile.jpg)

My name is Vladimir Petrovski and I am a mobile developer. I am very much interested in [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) and constantly exploring all related technologies to it. In the past I have worked on projects such as [Chipolo](https://chipolo.net), [Neutrino8](https://www.neutrino8.com/) platform and [Aerosleep](http://aerosleep.com/) smart baby monitor, all related to IoT.

I am deeply working on improving my open sources contributions, helping others and sharing my knowledge. I guess this page is one of them.
